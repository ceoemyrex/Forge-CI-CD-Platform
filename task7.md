DEVOPS TRACK — Stage 7 Task: Building a CI/CD platform with an integrated artifact registry (Forge)

Hey Cool Keeds! This is not a config task, it’s an engineering task.

You’re now Platform Engineer at HNG. Internal libs are built ad-hoc on laptops, deps come straight from public registries with no verification, versioning is inconsistent, and a junior just pulled a typosquatted package. Time to fix it.

Build forge a CI/CD platform with an integrated artifact registry. Two cooperating subsystems with one HTTP API:


A CI engine that reads YAML pipelines, spins up genuinely isolated build environments, streams logs live, and reports run status. Like a mini GitHub Actions runner.
An artifact registry + dependency resolver with version pinning, checksum verification, semver resolution, and immutability. Like a mini Artifactory or npm registry.


You are not wrapping shell scripts in a web server. You are building a system trustable with production builds.

Required Capabilities

Your platform must correctly handle each of these cases end-to-end:


Pipeline builds + publishes lib-core@1.0.0
Pipeline declares lib-core@^1.0.0, publishes lib-http@1.0.0
Pipeline declares both above, publishes service-api@0.1.0
Direct upload with wrong checksum → must reject with 400
Duplicate upload of lib-core@1.0.0 → must reject with 409 (immutability)
Pipeline with version conflict → must fail at resolution before any build runs
Build step attempts filesystem escape, memory exhaustion, and non-registry network egress → all three contained
Pipeline producing ~50MB streamed log output → logs stream live, not buffered


Provisioning

Linux VPS, min 4 vCPU / 4GB RAM / 40GB disk. Deploy with Docker Compose, publicly accessible at a static IP/domain, live throughout grading.

Allowed language: Python or Go. Long-lived services, not cron jobs.

What You Must Build

1. Pipeline YAML

name: build-lib-http
version: 1.0.0
dependencies:
  - name: lib-core
    version: "^1.0.0"
jobs:
  build:
    runtime: alpine:3.18
    resources: { cpu: 1.0, memory: 512Mi }
    steps:
      - { name: test, run: "sh ./test.sh" }
      - { name: package, run: "tar czf out.tar.gz src/" }
artifacts:
  - { name: lib-http, version: 1.0.0, path: ./out.tar.gz }

Strict validation: unknown fields error, missing required fields error, error message points at the offending line. Jobs share a workspace. Declared deps pulled to ./deps/<name>/ before any job runs. Listed artifacts published automatically after producing job succeeds. Platform injects FORGE_TOKEN and FORGE_URL per job for imperative forge publish.

2. Job DAG Execution

Jobs may declare needs: [...]. Scheduler must build a DAG, detect cycles before any job runs, topologically sort, and execute independent jobs in parallel up to a configurable concurrency limit. Failed job → dependents get marked as skipped, not failed. Implement the scheduler yourself, no workflow engine libs.

3. Isolated Build Environments

Each job enforced:


Filesystem: own workspace, host FS not visible
Process: cannot see/signal outside processes
Network: outbound only to your registry endpoint; everything else denied
CPU/memory: YAML limits enforced; OOM produces a clear log signal
Time: max wall-clock per job (default 30 min, configurable)


Acceptable: Linux containers via Docker/podman/runc, or manually-built namespaces + cgroups v2.
NOT acceptable: subprocess + chroot or anything without PID, mount, and network namespacing. We will try to escape it.

4. Real-Time Log Streaming

stdout/stderr stream live over Server-Sent Events. A client connecting mid-build receives backlog so far, then new lines as produced. Each line timestamped at write time. Logs persisted to disk. A 50MB log must remain streamable without loading it all into memory.

5. Artifact Registry


Content-addressable storage: blobs under SHA-256 hash; (name, version) points to hash in metadata
Compute SHA-256 server-side on upload; refuse if client-declared checksum mismatches
Published versions immutable, second upload to existing (name, version) → 409
Refuse non-semver versions
Metadata: name, version, SHA-256, size, publisher (token identity), publish timestamp, declared deps


SQLite or Postgres for metadata. JSON file is NOT acceptable.

6. Dependency Resolver


Parse semver constraints: exact, caret ^, tilde ~, and comparator ranges (>=1.0.0 <2.0.0)
Walk transitive graph via registry metadata
Detect cycles → clear error naming the cycle
Detect version conflicts → clear error showing both paths + constraints
Select highest version satisfying all constraints
Produce a lockfile with exact versions + SHA-256 hashes before any build step runs


Deterministic; same pipeline + same registry state must produce an identical lockfile, byte-for-byte. Implement yourself; no semver resolver library.

7. Checksum Verification at Pull Time

When a build env pulls a dep, the platform fetches it, recomputes SHA-256 from received bytes, and compares against the lockfile. On mismatch the entire pipeline fails with status integrity_failure and both hashes are logged.

8. Auth

Bearer token auth on all write operations. Tokens created via a CLI command on the host, stored hashed (not plaintext).

9. Slack Alerts

Webhook URL in your config file. Required events:


Pipeline started / succeeded / failed: pipeline, run ID, duration, failing job if any
Integrity failure: artifact coordinate, expected SHA-256, actual SHA-256, run ID. Must include tags for the right people being notified.
Resolution failure: pipeline, conflict or cycle details


10. CLI Tool

forge, pip-installable. Required commands:


forge login <url> — store credentials
forge run <pipeline.yaml> — submit a pipeline
forge logs <run-id> [--follow] — fetch logs
forge publish <path> --name <n> --version <v> — publish (used inside pipelines)
forge resolve <pipeline.yaml> — print the lockfile without running
forge ls <package> — list versions




Required HTTP API Contract

Your platform must expose these endpoints exactly as specified. All writes require `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

POST /runs                              multipart {pipeline: <file>}            → {run_id}
GET  /runs/{id}                                                                  → {status, jobs, lockfile_url}
GET  /runs/{id}/lockfile                                                         → {lockfile JSON}
GET  /runs/{id}/logs?follow=true        SSE stream (text/event-stream)           → stream of {ts, job, line}
POST /artifacts/{name}/{version}        multipart {file, checksum: sha256:hex}   → 201 / 400 / 409
GET  /artifacts/{name}/{version}                                                 → blob, header X-Artifact-SHA256
GET  /artifacts/{name}/{version}/meta                                            → {name, version, sha256, size, deps, published_at}
GET  /artifacts/{name}                                                           → {versions: [...]}

Required status values: queued, running, succeeded, failed, integrity_failure, conflict_failure, cycle_failure.

DOs and DON’Ts

DO: build the resolver, scheduler, and storage yourself — this is the entire point. Keep thresholds/paths/limits in a config file. Test your platform against all 8 required capabilities before submitting. Keep the platform live throughout grading.

DON’T:

Wrap an existing CI engine (Jenkins, GitLab Runner, Drone, Tekton, Argo, Woodpecker, GH Actions runner, etc.) - instant DQ
Wrap an existing registry (Artifactory, Nexus, Verdaccio, Harbor, Docker registry, etc.) - instant DQ
Use a semver resolver library
Fake isolation with subprocess + chroot
Allow a published version to be overwritten
Store tokens in plaintext
Use Kubernetes - Docker Compose on raw VPS only
